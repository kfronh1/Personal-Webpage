During my free time you’ll find me hiking a mountain, biking along the coast, kayaking in creeks or over waves, or practicing yoga on the beach. I enjoy birding and observing wildlife. I love all creatures, from tiny hairy spiders to ferocious mega fauna. I am partial to cats, but I like dogs as well.\r\nExperience: I graduated with my Bachelor’s degree in Biology from Towson University in 2017. Since 2016,I have worked for Baltimore County Department of Recreation and Parks as a Park Naturalist. As a Park Naturalist, I teach the public about nature, wildlife, and environmental concerns. I worked as an Environmental Educator for an environmental education non-profit for a year between my undergraduate and graduate schooling.\r\nProjects: I am currently working on the graduate group capstone project “Combining Conservation & Community Empowerment: Establishing Community Forests in DRC to Protect Critically Endangered Grauer’s Gorillas and Improve Well-Being of Impoverished Communities.” We are conducting connectivity, socioeconomic, and climate projections analyses to determine best planning and management actions for community forest success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
