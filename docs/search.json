During my free time you’ll find me hiking a mountain, biking along the coast, kayaking in creeks or over waves, or practicing yoga on the beach. I enjoy birding and observing wildlife. Wetlands are my favorite ecosystem! I love all creatures, from tiny hairy spiders to ferocious mega fauna. I am partial to cats, but I like dogs as well of course! I also love socializing, meeting knew people, and learning about new things!\r\nExperience: I graduated with my Bachelor’s degree in Biology & Ecology from Towson University in 2017. After graduating I embarked on a three-month solo trip around the world to explore 8 countries on 3 different continents. While abroad I volunteered at a wildlife game reserve in South Africa and an elephant sanctuary in Thailand. From 2016 to 2020, I worked for Baltimore County Department of Recreation and Parks as a Park Naturalist. I taught the public about nature, wildlife, and environmental concerns. I also worked as an Environmental Educator for an environmental education non-profit located at the northern tip of the Chesapeake Bay the year before starting at UCSB.\r\nProjects: I am currently working on the graduate group capstone project Combining Conservation & Community Empowerment: Protecting Grauer’s Gorillas with Community Forestry. We conducted connectivity, socioeconomic, and climate change projection analyses to recommend best conservation and community development planning and management actions for community forest success.

      "description": "**Combining Conservation & Community Empowerment: Protecting Grauer’s Gorillas with Community Forestry** - I am working with Zoe Duerksen-Salm, Monica Gordon, Yani Pohl, and Lizzy Schattle on a project to support the conservation and community development work of Strong Roots Congo in the Sud Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We have conducted connectivity, socioeconomic, and climate change projection analyses to identify management and planning recommendations for the proposed community forest network that will act as a wildlife corridor between Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Itombwe Nature Reserve. This corridor has the potential to link two of the largest remaining sub-populations of the critically endangered Grauer's gorilla (*Gorilla beringei graueri*), which is endemic to the lowland Congo Basin rainforests and plays a vital role in forest ecosystem processes and services.\n",

      "contents": "\r\nCombining Conservation & Community Empowerment: Protecting Grauer’s Gorillas with Community Forestry\r\nStrong Roots Congo is working to protect biodiversity and empower local communities in the Sud Kivu province along the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through community forestry and sustainable development projects. Grauer’s gorillas are among the many species that call the Congo Basin rain forest their home. Due to multiple threats from poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation, deforestation, resource extraction activities, and civil unrest Grauer’s gorillas were classified as critically endangered on the 2016 IUCN Red List.\r\n\r\nGrauer’s gorillas:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: A silverback Grauer’s gorilla named Chimanuka that lives in Kahuzi-Biega National Park (Credit: Strong Roots Congo)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrauer’s gorillas play an integral role in tropical rainforest ecology by dispersing seeds and creating cleared areas of the forest where seedlings can germinate with their foraging and nesting habits (Basabose 2016). Grauer’s gorilla’s home ranges have been found to extend 42.3 km2 over 92 months, while shifting and expanding their range monthly and annually, respectively (Yamagiwa 2011). Grauer’s gorillas’ prime habitat is primary forest but their home ranges have been found to extend through primary and secondary forests, bamboo forests, and swampland (Yamagiwa 2011). Their ranging patterns are similar to that of Eastern mountain gorillas, in that they reflect a strategy of seeking high-quality herbaceous vegetation while avoiding previously used areas that contain trampled vegetation (Vedder 1984; Watts 1987, 1998).\r\nGrauer’s gorillas are gregarious and live in family groups, consisting of one silverback male, several adult females, and juveniles. Female Grauer’s gorillas become sexually mature at 9 years of age. Adult females typically give birth to a single infant every four years, with a 8.5 to 9.5 month gestation period. Infant mortality rates are high before the age of 3 due to disease, infanticide, and other natural ailments (Dian Fossey 2014). Gorillas who make it past 3 years of age have a typical life expectancy of 35 to 50 years in the wild. Because of their long life span, late maturity, long gestation period, and high infant mortality rate, Grauer’s gorillas are particularly vulnerable to threats. Prior to civil war in the DRC in 1996 the Grauer’s gorilla population was estimated to be ~16,900 individuals, now however, only an estimated 3,800 individuals remain in the wild (Plumptre et al. 2016).\r\n\r\nThreats & Current Population:\r\nHistorically, Grauer’s gorilla range encompassed an area of about 52,000 km2, however intact and available habitat declined by 52% between the 1990s and 2000s (Junker et al. 2013). Human population growth and the increasing demand for arable land and resources is the main cause of gorilla habitat loss in the eastern DRC. The South Kivu region, where Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Itombwe Nature Reserve are located, has a high human density (over 300 people/km2) and an annual population growth rate of 4% (Yamagiwa 2011). Local communities depend on the resources from the land for daily life and use native plants for construction, food, fuel, and medicine; consequently much of the forest has been deforested and degraded by farming, mining, and logging. The agricultural practice of shifting cultivation and exploitative resource extraction have resulted in an increasingly fragmented landscape. Clearings are carved out of the forest to create new, nutrient-rich agricultural fields (Potapov et al. 2012), which then allow for secondary resource extraction, such as timber and mining operations (Geist and Lambin 2002, DeWasseige et al. 2012). When habitat becomes fragmented, Grauer’s gorillas are more likely to encounter humans and are at higher risk from poaching for bushmeat. Due to their large size and terrestrial movement gorillas are considered easy targets for prime bushmeat (Plumptre et al. 2016). Poaching also occurs for the wildlife trade; a whole family group can be killed in the attempts to capture an infant gorilla for the black market.\r\nDue to these multiple threats Grauer’s gorillas have suffered a 77% decline in population over the past twenty years, which is a single Grauer’s gorilla generation (Plumptre et al. 2016). This massive decline resulted in the classification of Grauer’s gorillas as Critically Endangered on the 2016 IUCN Red List. Critically endangered is the highest threat level, meaning they are at extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. The current Grauer’s gorilla population occupies only ~13% of their original range (Mehlman 2008) and are isolated into four subpopulations within protected areas; Maiko National Park, Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Itombwe Nature Reserve, and Tanya Gorilla Reserve (Yamagiwa, 2011).\r\n\r\nStudy Region:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur study focuses on a community forest network that Strong Roots is developing with the local chiefdoms in the 3,000 square kilometers of unprotected land between Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Itombwe Nature Reserve The interconnected community forests outlined on the map above will form the wildlife corridor between the parks. The reforestation zones are areas designated by Strong Roots to undergo ecological restoration by way of tree plantings in the near future. We ran the analyses on this corridor and the surrounding landscape as there is potential for the community forest to be expanded in the future.\r\n\r\nProject Goal & Objectives:\r\nOur goal is to help Strong Roots and the local communities develop a conservation plan that will ensure the long term persistence of Grauer’s gorillas by providing management recommendations for the community forests that will connect gorilla populations in Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Itombwe Nature Reserve and promote sustainable economic development.\r\nWe came up with 3 main objectives will help us to accomplish this goal:\r\nModel current functional connectivity for Grauer’s gorillas between Kahuzi Biega National Park and Itombwe Nature Reserve and investigate how climate change may affect gorilla habitat\r\nAnalyze local communities’ opinions about existing forest protections to understand the degree of local support for conservation goals and primary community concerns\r\nDevelop recommendations and tools for spatial and community development planning for the network of community forests\r\n\r\nMethods & Results:\r\nThe presentation of our methods and results are pending approval from the client.\r\n\r\nRecommendations:\r\nFrom our results we will provide spatial and community development management recommendations that will identify:\r\nPriority conservation areas for gorilla movement\r\nBarriers to gorilla movement to prioritize for restoration\r\nAreas of resilience towards climate change\r\nAreas of least ecological impact for resource extraction and sustainable community development\r\nThe primary forestry concerns of local communities and groups\r\n\r\nWorks Cited:\r\nBasabose, Augustin K, et al. (June, 2016) Gorilla Journal.
